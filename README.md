# From Interference Mitigation to Toleration: Pathway to Practical Spatial Reuse in LPWANs
HydraNet can improve spatial reuse and optimize spectrum efficiency in LPWANs.

This webpage contains source code to deploy HydraNet.


## Overview
Low Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) suffer from sever interference due to their long range transmissions. Traditional spatial reuse solutions share a common philosophy, i.e., interference mitigation. 

HydraNet is a new paradigm to facilitate simultaneous LPWAN transmissions on the same frequency,fundamentally evolving the current philosophy of interference managementâ€”from mitigating interference to tolerating its presence.
